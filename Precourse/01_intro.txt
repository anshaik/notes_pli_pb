right to EXCLUDE.
-> you have to do the sueing

diligence - uninterrupted work to an end (keep after it until you succeed). If you stop, then the only way to get a date is through a complete patent application.

Office of initial examination - is the application complete. are the formalties met?

half of all applications come outside of the united states (translations need to be included, must be in english)

after, forwarded to examination. 

most, 18 months after are published (after passing initial examination). some exceptions (i.e. opt-out until patented)
after first action:

amendment
-> may not add subject matter as it is in the original form


generally speaking, the second action is a "final" action

means: your application only has 6 months left to live.
-> you can appeal final rejection
-> file new case (continuation)
-> file new modifications 


Notice of allowance 
-> pay issue fee within 3 months
-> patent issued within 2 months after paid

if denied;
-> option to appeal
-> 2-3 years later you get a resolution from this
--> 2nd appeal to federal circuit
