Law of Patents
-------
35 USC 101
----
5 requirements to get a patent
patent eligibke, useful, novel, nonobvious, described well

101 -> patentable subject matter and utility

more interesting to talk about what is NOT patentable; this is bc MANY things are patentable in the US

utility: is the claimed invention something that is useful
-> does the invention work the way you're claiming that it works

i.e. you say your invention kills cancer. if it kills cancer, it meets the requirement of utility
